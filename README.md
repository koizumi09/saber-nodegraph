# Saber Node-Graph
*A Node-Graph based **Visual Programming** wrapper for Python*

Author : Sagar Kowe 

`Saber` is a Node Graph based Visual Programming interface that is essentially a Node Graph implementation through `Excalidraw`, interpreted by a `python` powered backend. 

- Supports all the libraries and built-ins of Python.
- Typing is based off Python's typing.
- Free and Open Source. 
- Heavily inspired from Unreal Engine's Blueprints and Node editors.

`Saber` is named after my late cat Saber, may she rest in peace. Made free and open source to immortalize her name and contribute to the community.
